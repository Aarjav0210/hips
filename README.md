# Hierarchical Inference of Progression Stage (HIPS)
HIPS is a hierarchical transformer framework for inferring Alzheimer’s disease pathology staging from single-nucleus transcriptomic data. By using the brain’s inherent cellular and cell-type hierarchy, HIPS is able to account for biological context across multiple organizational levels to identify molecular changes associated with Alzheimer’s disease progression.
